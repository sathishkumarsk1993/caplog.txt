Our destination is Planet Deneb IV, beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy. My orders are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile I'm becoming better acquainted with my new command â€“ this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise. I'm still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity. As for my crew, we are short in several key positions, most notably a first officer, but I'm informed that a highly experienced man, one Commander William Riker, will be waiting to join the ship at our Deneb IV destination.

We are downloading the research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. 
I am concerned at being in such close orbit but the Tsiolkovsky's research records will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse
The strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Enterprise and our engineering section has been commandeered by young Wesley Crusher
It is no longer an inconvenient childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victim of the Tsiolkovsky infection is now in control of my starship.
